### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Manu Candelaria aka Dr. Calavera aka Lorenzo M. Candelaria**
I do stuff, and I know stuff. Not really a developer but know enough to get things done. Almost 20 years working in tech. 

A few things about me:

- Iâ€™m currently working on a cool IoT project. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, and will hopefully be certified soon. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything.
